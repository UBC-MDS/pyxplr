## Package Overview

`pyxplr` is a python package to make explatory data analysis (EDA) simple and seamless. EDA is a crucial phase in the data science workflow as it allows us get a fist glimpse of the data. It is important to identify statistical characteristics of the data so that we can properly set up the rest of the analysis. 

## Functions

- `get_summary`
- `get_featureviz`
- `get_outliers`
- `get_na`

## Python Ecosystem

This python package will build upon the `pandas` and `altair` python packages that will make first time data science users get started in their projects more easily. A similar package `pandas profiling?` achieves a similar EDA tool. (not complete)
