`pyxplr` is a python package to make explatory data analysis (EDA) simple and seamless. EDA is a crucial phase in the data science workflow as it allows us get a fist glimpse of the data. It is important to identify statistical characteristics of the data so that we can properly set up the rest of the analysis.

### Credits
This package was created with Cookiecutter and the UBC-MDS/cookiecutter-ubc-mds project template, modified from the [pyOpenSci/cookiecutter-pyopensci](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/cookiecutter-pyopensci) project template and the [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage).

### Python Ecosystem

This python package will build upon the `pandas` and `altair` python packages that will make first time data science users get started in their projects more easily. A similar package `pandas profiling?` achieves a similar EDA tool. (not complete)
